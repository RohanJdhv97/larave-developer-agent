# Implementation Strategy

## Overview

This implementation strategy outlines the approach for developing the application, including admin UI, API structure, background processing, and authentication.

## Authentication Strategy

Recommended Authentication: sanctum

## Admin Panels

### Main Admin Dashboard
Description: Primary administrative interface for system management

User Roles:
- admin
- super_admin

Components:

#### UserManagement (table)
Description: Interface for managing user accounts
Entities: User

Fields:
- id
- name
- email
- created_at
- status

Actions:
- view
- edit
- delete
- impersonate

Layout Notes: Implement with filters for status and search by name/email

#### UserCreationForm (form)
Description: Form for creating new user accounts
Entities: User

Fields:
- name
- email
- password
- password_confirmation
- role

Actions:
- save
- cancel

Layout Notes: Implement with validation and role selection dropdown

Navigation Structure:
- Dashboard (icon: dashboard)
- Users (icon: users)
  - users
  - roles
  - permissions

## API Structure
Architecture: rest
Base Path: /api
Version: v1
Authentication: sanctum
Documentation Format: swagger

Endpoints:

### GET /api/v1/users
Description: Get all users (paginated)
Authentication Required: Yes
Rate Limited: Yes

Request Parameters:
- page: integer
- per_page: integer
- search: string

Response Format:
- data: array of user objects
- meta: pagination information

### GET /api/v1/users/{id}
Description: Get user by ID
Authentication Required: Yes
Rate Limited: No

Request Parameters:
- id: integer

Response Format:
- data: user object

## Background Jobs

### ProcessUserUpload
Description: Process user uploaded files (resize images, extract metadata, etc.)
Processing Type: background

Data Requirements:
- user_id
- file_path
Estimated Duration: medium

### SendWelcomeEmail
Description: Send welcome email to newly registered users
Processing Type: background

Data Requirements:
- user_id
- email
Estimated Duration: short

## Implementation Notes
1. Begin with core database migrations and models before implementing API endpoints
2. Consider implementing repository pattern for complex data access requirements
3. Use resource classes for consistent API responses
4. Implement comprehensive validation with form request classes
5. Set up CI/CD pipeline early to automate testing
6. Consider Redis for queue processing to handle background jobs efficiently
7. Implement rate limiting on public-facing API endpoints
8. Use Laravel Sanctum for API authentication
9. Set up database factories and seeders for testing and development
